As you traverse the inky void of space, a mysterious asteroid looms ahead - a relic of untold cosmic ages, its secrets concealed by a rugged exterior. But fear not, for you possess a remarkable tool - the 3D Asteroid Scanner, capable of illuminating the darkest corners of this enigmatic body.

Your first task is to uncover the total surface area of the asteroid, a formidable challenge that requires a thorough examination of each voxel, each cube of one cubic meter. But do not be deterred, for your scanner shall provide a list of voxel coordinates to aid you in your quest.

Next, you must seek out the largest leveled area, a connected surface of the same elevation. The complexity of the asteroid's surface demands that you take all sides into consideration as you explore its rugged terrain.

Finally, your greatest challenge awaits - the maximum landing surface area. Defined as a circle of the same elevation, this task requires you to navigate the treacherous landscape of the asteroid to uncover the largest landing surface in squared meters, rounding your answer to two decimal places.

Remember, as you embark on this perilous journey, that the asteroid is homogeneous from the inside, free of any holes or cavities that might impede your progress. May the light of your scanner guide you through the darkness and reveal the mysteries of this cosmic artifact.
Input and output format

The input is a list of the asteroid voxels:

(x1,y1,z1)
(x2,y2,z2)
(x3,y3,z3)
...
(xN,yN,zN)

The output consists of three numbers:

A B C

    A - Total asteroid surface area
    B - The largest asteroid surface area
    C - The largest asteroid landing area

Maximum error allowed for largest asteroid landing area is 0.1.
